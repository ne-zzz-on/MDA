								<br/>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;Founded in 1981 by Antonio Argibay and Bice C. Wilson in a loft in New York City’s Chinatown, we now have offices near Madison Square Park in Manhattan and in Miami, and associated offices in Geneva and Buenos Aires.<br/>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of our work requires complex, mission-critical pro- grams, often involving novel technologies necessitating skill- ful design and coordination.  Our decades of experience with this kind of work enable us to devise simple, sophisticated designs in these conditions.  We have a unique ability to ma- nifest the elegant design solution which lies at the heart of every project. 
								</span>
								<span class="column">
								<br/>
								<br/>
								<br/>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;
								Our commitment to Inte- grated Design – a broadly based balance of creativity, management and common sense – assures clients that the remarkable solutions we pro- pose are practical, prudent and designed to serve for decades.<br/>								
								&nbsp;&nbsp;
								Over nearly three decades, the firm has accomplished a variety of project types, including single- and multi-family residences, workplaces, complex broadcast and media facilities, cultural centers, and corporate headquarters. We are also nationally recognized leaders in the field of urban and environmental planning.

								&nbsp;&nbsp;
								A large proportion of our work is for clients who have turned to us for many years - successful people who have relied on us throughout their careers.

								The Art of Architecture is in the tangible articulation of visionary ideas, elegantly expressing the broadest possible spectrum of form givers and conditions – elegant in the scientific sense of the word:  the most succinct and evocative expression of a set of conditions. This Art achieves value when it is informed by the practical skills that ground vision in science, politics, law, logistics and fiscal prudence.<br/>
								We are Practical Visionaries.<br/><br/>

								Architecture is a process.  Our process is one of collaboration, synthesizing our client’s needs, culture, values, aspirations and commitments with the insight, wisdom, creativity, management skills and common sense our firm has developed over the past three decades.<br/><br/> 
							Meridian Design Associates provides leadership in that process, a careful balance of creativity, resourcefulness and common sense.

								<h2>Bice C. Wilson, AIA</h2>
								<h3>Principal</h3><br/>
								<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;  
								Bice has been described as a “practical visionary.”  On one hand, he has an unusual ability to articulate the visionary possibilities in the projects he takes on.  On the other hand, architecture is about making new structures happen, and Bice has a long track record of skillfully managing the realization of challenging undertakings.
								<br/>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;  
One key role Bice plays on many projects is to assist his clients in finding the simple and powerful concepts which express the synthesis of their needs, abilities and the places they seek to adapt for their use.  With these concepts in hand, the process of making architecture can be much easier than many expect, and will serve the client’s interests in the most comprehensive possible way.</p>
