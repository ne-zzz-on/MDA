						<object><h2>Principal</h2></object>
						<br/>
						Bice has been described as a “practical visionary.”  On one hand, he has an unusual ability to articulate the visionary possibilities in the projects he takes on.  On the other hand, architecture is about making new structures happen, and Bice has a long track record of skillfully managing the realization of challenging undertakings.
						<br/>
						One key role Bice plays on many projects is to assist his clients in finding the simple and powerful concepts which express the synthesis of their needs, abilities and the places they seek to adapt for their use.  With these concepts in hand, the process of making architecture can be much easier than many expect, and will serve the client’s interests in the most comprehensive possible way.<br/><br/><br/>
						<object><h2>Project Experience</h2></object>
						Bice possesses a broad range of design experience, including single and multi-family housing, adaptive re-use of existing buildings, community planning,

						office buildings, restaurants, retail complexes and public art projects.  His most recent residential projects are The Prime, a luxury condominium located in the Meat Packing district of Manhattan, and Horton’s Mill Village, a work-force housing community on a historically significant and environ- mentally sensitive site in White Plains.
						<br/>
						He is also recognized for his expertise in the design of the Creative Economy workplace, having served clients such as CBS, Martha Stewart, WWE and many others.

His work in this area has been exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Design. He was awarded an Urban Design Award of Excellence by the American Institute of Architects for his achievements in this field.
						<br/>

						<br/>
						His sculpture "Sun, Radiants and Shadows" has been exhibited at the Philadelphia Art Alliance. Bice has also built several site-specific sculptures throughout the country in the traditions of geomancy and archeo-astronomy.
